# Research Group Website Template

This is a Vanilla Web Development (HTML/CSS/JS) template for a research group website, designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages.

## Structure

- `index.html`: Home page with recent research highlights.
- `members.html`: Team members introduction.
- `publications.html`: List of publications and research work.
- `news.html`: Archive of group news.
- `assets/`: Contains CSS, JavaScript, and Image files.

## How to Customize

1.  **Edit Content**: Open the `.html` files and replace the placeholder text with your actual content.
2.  **Add Images**: Place your images in `assets/images/` and update the `src` attributes in the HTML files.
3.  **Styles**: Modify `assets/css/style.css` to change colors, fonts, and layout.
4.  **Navigation**: If you add new pages, update the `<nav>` section in all HTML files.

## Deployment on GitHub Pages

1.  Commit and push these files to your GitHub repository (`username.github.io` or a project repo).
2.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages** in your GitHub repository.
3.  Under **Source**, select `Deploy from a branch`.
4.  Select the branch (usually `main` or `master`) and folder (`/` root).
5.  Click **Save**. Your site will be live at `https://username.github.io/` (or `.../project-name`).
